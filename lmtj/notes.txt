I have to find more photos but it's going to be tricky!

here are the one's that we can include for the wedding party pictures. the names of the people are in the name of the pictures. 
some are doubles of people because I wasn't sure how they were going to fit into the circles on the site so whatever works is fine. 
I thought it'd be fun to have as many pictures as possible with TJ with my wedding party "side" and me with tj's side

I also thought it might be cool if we had a photo "timeline" of tj and I...one photo for each year we've been together...what do you think?

i'm also working on finding or taking a new picture for the background of the "all you need is love" part.



HOTEL

We have rooms blocked! 10 for Friday night (I'll be staying Friday night and getting ready in the hotel for Saturday so we figured we'd block some so people have that option) and 30 for Saturday night.

Newton Holiday Inn Express (973) 940-8888

o I def like the Annie Use Your Telescope font better on the site. good call. i'm second guessing the script font I sent you. 
I feel like it's too bold and I think we can find better so I'll look at google fonts again.

love the color scheme- those are pretty much what I was picturing for the day.

should we add NJ in the first part explaining where the wedding is?

I went on this women's videography site: http://www.mckenziemillerfilms.com/ and like that she has a photo in the background stay still. 
don't know how easy or hard that would be to do. I'd have to get you a good picture too. maybe where the "all you need is love" quote is, 
there can be a picture in the background there instead of a color...? just an idea!

the wedding party will most likely be 7 girls and 9 guys.

also, I have been thinking about possibly having people fill something out when they rsvp....possibly a song they want to hear..? 
I'm trying to think of something creative so I'll let you know IF I do.

where you have what can we bring? I LOVE the dancin' shoes part. is it bad if we don't include registry info? haha, we are trying to make a 
teeny tiny registry because we can't fit anything else in our house and we know we're going to get a decent amount from the shower. 
I don't really know etiquette so I could be way off with taking that part out.

where to stay info: we are going to block rooms at Holiday Inn Express in Newton 
(to enjoy (hungover) breakfast with everyone the morning after!). also, close by is the Andover Inn. 

other ideas I have to possibly incorporate (that the invites may also have): mason jar, polaroid picture look....just throwing things out there. 
mason jar might not fit with this site

Hey Lis, my comments:
- pick any other font you'd like, it's super easy to switch and try versions. If I have time I'll even just throw a few in there and send you 
different versions. Also, I'll double check that I don't have 'bold' turned on for those headings, if so I'll turn it off and might like it better
- glad you like the colors! I used a site called kuler that people use to create and share color schemes. I think I picked one called fall wedding or something, I looked for one with a nice green in it. You can look at that too (it's a very useful site for any designing you do). So if you want to make slight changes that's easy too
- I will add 'Augusta, New Jersey' to the intro text, I honk that's a good idea. I was also thinking of making some kind of hand drawn map that points out kinnelon and Augusta on the map... It would have to be very carefully done though because it would have to really match the design of the rest of the site. I'll see what happens
- I think I can pull off that photo effect ;) let me see what I can do. And speaking of the 'All you need is love' there's an interesting thing we can do with it, I don't know if it fits anywhere or anything but it can chain together infinitely:
all you need is love is all you need is love is all you need is love is all you need... Etc. 
- wedding party: we can do names, nicknames, quotes they can write, little introductions of who they are and why they are special to you, whatever you'd like 
- song requests: I love that idea! I was thinking of ways to make the site a bit more interactive, so anything you can think of along those lines would be great. Maybe the song requests would pop up on the site as people made them? Or maybe like a 'wall' that people could post messages to? Think about it
- yeah the registry thing is tricky. We didn't have one and we just didn't say anything. But it could be cute to just say 'we have a tiny house, so tiny things are good' or something like that... But whatever you guys decide is best. 
- I'll put the hotel info in there. Maybe that's a good spot for the hand drawn map? Like where the hotels are in relation to the ceremony. Any of those hotels dog friendly? A bunch of people asked us about that
- I can change the circles on the wedding party part into Polaroids maybe... Hmmm

-sooo...here's some other script fonts that may look better? Meie Script, Playball, Vibur, Kristi . it's hard to tell when it's not up against the colors of the site and the other font.
-kuler...what a "KULE" site! glad you shared it with me :) might make the invitation-making easier.
-so funny you brought that up because I was going to ask if there was any way we could create a map. maybe that's something I can try and figure out in photoshop....that's a pretty ambitious thought so we'll see! I agree it would be great to map out the conservatory to the hotel... and maybe anything interesting in between (bars, coffee shops, cows, ya know!).
-all you need is love is all you need ..... YES! I LOVE that idea to keep repeating it, makes perfect sense!
-wedding party info...all sounds perfect. we'll think of some things to write about each :)
-song requests and making the site interactive...I like the idea of having them pop up on the site somehow. very cool! also, that made me think...it'd be cool too if when people RSVP, a fun message came up whether they say yes or no. so for yes, maybe "glad you can make it! don't forget your dancin' shoes" (or something a lot more fun than that but i'm not witty or cool) and if no, maybe something like "aw man! we're sorry that you can't make it...we'll miss you!" ......again, i'm not the one making the site so I don't know how easy or hard these things are so PLEASE tell me no if it's something that just won't work.
-i'm thinking that we just won't add the registry information. we are only making one for shower purposes so hoping for only money for the wedding.
-hmmm...the hotel is the Holiday Inn Express so it's def not dog friendly....i'm not sure what people would do with their dogs. I would recommend a good kennel but I don't know any and I wouldn't trust only websites. I will ask around from people that live in that area to see what they think.
